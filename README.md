# Train Time

This is a simple train schedule application that incorporates HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Google Firebase, and Moment.js. 

## Getting Started
Enter the name of the train, its destination, the time it starts running every day, and the frequency with which the train runs. Upon clicking submit, the data will be added to the table above. Based on the start time and train frequency entered by the user, as well as the current moment logged upon clicking the submit button, the table will also display the time the next train will arrive and how many minutes until it arrives.
